  TimesUp is a self-destructing to-do list application that encourages users to complete weekly tasks.
  Users have a 7 day time period at which the tasks must be completed before it is automatically removed.
</p>
<p>
  Creating and deleting tasks were the main focus of the application. The app is aimed to handle large volumes of tasks.
  Custom functions were added to handle the creation a deletion of tasks by the user. AJAX was implemented
  which allowed the creation and deletion of tasks to be executed without having to refresh the page each time,
  resulting in unobtrusive interaction. In order to automate the deletion of items, Rake was incorporated.
  A custom rake task was coded, defining the moment an item is created. A specified time period would then be set
  in which the item will be deleted if not yet complete.

## Problem and Challenges

 Using the Ruby on Rails framework, develop an application that allows users to add and check off completed tasks.
 Tasks are then automatically removed after a certain period of time if not completed.

<div class="col-all">
  <dl>
    <dt class="heading">Creating and Deleting Tasks</dt>
      <dd class="col-info">
        Creating and deleting tasks is the main focus of the application.
        The app is aimed at a large volume of tasks. Therefore the ability to create and delete tasks
        had to be implemented in a way that allowed seamless user interaction.
      </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt class="heading">Automatic Removal of Incomplete Tasks</dt>
      <dd class="col-info">
        Creating a system to automatically delete items after a certain time period has passed was
        the main challenge. Items upon creation should initiate a timer where, after a certain amount
        of time has passed, would be deleted if not yet completed by the user.
      </dd>
  </dl>
</div>

## Solution

<div class="col-all">
  <dl>
    <dt class="heading">Implementing AJAX</dt>
      <dd class="col-info">
        Ajax was implemented to manage the create and delete functions of the application.
        This allowed the creation and deletion of tasks to be executed without having to refresh
        the page each time, resulting in unobtrusive interaction.
      </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt class="heading">Rake Automation</dt>
      <dd class="col-info">
        In order to automate the deletion of items, Rake was incorporated. A custom rake task was
        created,  defining the moment an item is created. A specified time period was set in which the
        item will be deleted if not yet complete.
      </dd>
  </dl>
</div>

## Results

A to-do list application where users can add tasks which are automatically deleted after the time period expires. This encourages users to complete tasks within that time period leading to increase productivity.
