    A web tool that allows activity tracking on registered web applications. Designing and building an API from scratch posed some challenges.
    The biggest issue would be the management and communication of data between the server-side and
    the client-side.
  </p>
  <p>
    The entire service was constructed using Ruby on Rails. In order for the service to
    track events from registered applications, custom API routes and a controller were added, along
    with a custom Javascript snippet that would be included on the client side.
    This Javascript snippet tracks an event which then makes an AJAX request to the server-side enabling the
    event to be added to the user's registered application. To display tracked events so that users can visualize the data, graphs were used.
    The Chartkick gem was installed that allowed the creation of graphs with the number
    of tracked events on each application.

## Problems and Challenges

Designing and building an API from scratch posed some challenges.
The biggest issue would be the management and communication of data between the server-side and
the client-side.

<div class="col-all">

      <dt class="heading">Receiving and Tracking Events</dt>
        <dd class="col-info">
          We wanted our service to feature the registry of various applications.
          Registered applications needed to be be able to manage, receive, and track events from the
          client-side.
        </dd>
  </dl>
