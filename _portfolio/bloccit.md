## Overview
Reddit is one of the most popular sharing and web applications in the world. Replicating an application like Reddit using Ruby on Rails brings a set of challenges but also allows the one to discover how the application functions.

## Problem

The project required the design and development based on an already existing web application. Highlighting key features and aspects which had to be built from the ground up included creation of topic and posts models, user authentication, and user interaction.

Voting Issues
  Implementing, from the ground up, a voting feature for users posed some problems. Interaction with the vote model did not generate a change in value of the votes total.
