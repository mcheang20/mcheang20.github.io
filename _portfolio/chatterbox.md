## Overview

BlocJams is a digital web music player that allows users to stream their favorite music anytime, anywhere.  

## Problem and Challenges

Taking similar concepts from similar websites, design and develop an application from scratch using Javascript, Jquery, and AngularJS that enables users to stream and listen to music from all platforms.

<div class="checkbox col3">
  <dl class="row col-md-4">
      <dt class="info-col">User Control Bar Functionality</dt>
        <dd>
          The control bar gives users an interface to control the music they listen to. Therefore a proper control bar had to be designed that allowed users to play/pause a song, skip forwards or backwards and adjust volume settings.
        </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl class="row col-md-4">
      <dt class="info-col">Data Reference Consistency</dt>
        <dd>
          The application required the ability to hold song data consistently without interruption. This functionality was implemented to allow users to navigate to different pages without pausing or reloading the song if one is currently playing.
        </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl class="row col-md-4">
      <dt class="info-col">Playback Setting</dt>
        <dd>
          One requirement needed was song playback functionality. Users could play/pause songs and skip forward or backwards but were unable to skip to any point in the song.   Song attribute changes had to be observed to properly determine the correct playback position of a song.  Users can continue listening to the point at which the song was stopped while the attributes are updated.  
        </dd>
  </dl>
</div>
