    Chatter is a quick and simple messaging client that allows users to send and receive messages in
    realtime with their group or team. The focus was to develop an application where exchange of messages between users to be
    seamless. This meant incorporating a database and backend service to manage the transfer of data
    between users and the database.
  </p>
  <p>
    The application was aimed to handle large amounts of messages to be transferred between users.
    Angular JS was used along with injecting the Firebase service to develop and form the backend.
    The use of a simple backend service like Firebase allows for easy synchronization between
    data and user interaction. The UI was designed with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. To gather any data form the user,
    a custom cookies service was created along with the use of Bootstrap's $UIMdodal service.

  <dl>
      <dt class="heading">Keeping It Simple</dt>
        <dd class="col-info">
          We wanted users to be able to access the application without the requirement of
          creating an account and  signing in and out for quick and simple usage.

## Solution

<div class="col-all-2">
  <dl>
      <dt class="heading">Firebase</dt>
        <dd class="info-col">
          The solution for a database system was the use of the Firebase service.
          This provided a simple way for handling and syncing data with the backend allowing for
          realtime messaging capabilities.

      <dt class="heading">AngularJS</dt>
        <dd class="info-col">
          The application was built using Angular JS along with injecting the Firebase service.
          Using Angular allows for simple configuration of routes and controllers.
          In combination of using a simple backend service like Firebase, this allows for easy
          synchronization between data and user interaction.

  <dl>
      <dt class="heading">Cookies Service</dt>
        <dd class="info-col">
          To efficiently store a users information, the ngCookies module was injected.
          To retrieve data input from the user, Bootstrap's $UIMdodal service was used allowing the
          creation of data in realtime. Users would then only need to create a username to access the
          application.
        </dd>
  </dl>
</div>

## Results

A quick and easy messaging application where users can message in realtime with their group or team.
