## Problem and Challenges

The objective of this project was to develop an interactive and social application.
Travelog would implement features that allows users to share content, interact with other users,
and provide a subscription service.

<div class="col-all">
  <dl>
      <dt class="heading">User Authentication</dt>
        <dd class="col-info">
          A proper authentication system was needed in order for users to securely create an
          account as well as sign in and out of the application.
        </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
      <dt class="heading">Notification System</dt>
        <dd class="col-info">
          User content interaction is a key feature of Travelog. A notification system had to be
          established to notify users of any actions on their posts such as liking and commenting.
          However issues with the notification functionality were present and had to be resolved.
        </dd>
  </dl>
</div>
<div class="col-all">
  <dl>
      <dt class="heading">Premium Service</dt>
        <dd class="col-info">
          In order to restrict the amount of content that could be posted by users, posts were limited to
          a certain amount per day. To remove this restriction on users we wanted to add a premium service
          option where it would be a subscription based service.
        </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
      <dt class="heading">Image and Video Upload</dt>
        <dd class="col-info">
          Part of Travelog's content sharing experience was to allow users to upload images and videos.
          A problem arose with video uploading resulting in videos being uploaded however the video would not
          be playable.
        </dd>
  </dl>
</div>

## Solution

<div class="col-all">
  <dl>
      <dt class="heading">Devise Authentication</dt>
        <dd class="col-info">
          Utilizing the Ruby on Rails framework, a simple solution for authentication was adding the Devise gem.
           With this gem we area able to handle account creation as well as handling user sessions.
        </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
      <dt class="heading">Notification using Rails and jQuery</dt>
        <dd class="col-info">
          A notification system was built and designed using Jquery, Ruby, Javascript, and AJAX.
          This ensured a proper way of creating and sending notifications consistently.
        </dd>
  </dl>
</div>
<div class="col-all">
  <dl>
      <dt class="heading">Stripe integration</dt>
        <dd class="col-info">
          The answer to implementing a subscription payment service involved the use of Stripe.
          The Stripe platform's architecture and code allowed the secure handling of user payment and routing
          of money. Once a user has successfully made a payment they are automatically upgraded to a premium member.
        </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
      <dt class="heading">Implementing Paperclip</dt>
        <dd class="col-info">
          The Paperlcip gem was used to allow users to upload their images. Javascript code was added to enable
          the uploading of videos.
        </dd>
  </dl>
</div>

## Results

A unique content-sharing application where users can share their travel experiences with the world.  Users can interact with others, explore, or learn more about different locations and plan their future trips.
