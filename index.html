      <h3>Code</h3>
      <p>
        Though most of my work is focused on the front end: single page applications, HTML/CSS/JS,
        I enjoy working on the back end as well.
        I am well-versed with various programming languages such as Ruby,
        HTML, CSS, and  Javascript. I also have experience working with Ruby on Rails, AngularJS,
         and Wordpress.

          <p class="truncate">I never knew anything about writing code, wether its Ruby, or Javascript,
            until about 10 months ago. So how did a field that I knew very little of become
            something that Iâ€™m very passionate about?  It all started with some HTML and CSS.

            Like most people out there, if you happen to come across some HTML or Javascript code,
            you have not the slightest clue as to what it means or what it does. However, it has
            always fascinated me wondering how it all functions. How do lines and lines of code
            create a fully functioning application that we, the users, are able to see and interact
            with? I did a little research and stumbled upon a site called CodeAcademy, a free
            interactive program that teaches the basics of various programming languages. With this tool I was able to delve deeper into my coding curiosity and I was hooked!

            Starting with HTML and CSS, then working my way to Javascript and Ruby I began to
            gain a better understanding of the design and concepts of code. Having worked through the
             CodeAcademy courses, I learned more and more but, most important, I was also having fun
             at the same time. Seeing it all come together and getting a little better understanding
             I wanted to learn more.

            Learning code was just a hobby at this point, but I wanted to expand my knowledge
            and have coding and programming mean more than just a side project. At this point I
            decided, leave the comfortable career path that I already had chosen, or start fresh
            and new and further develop my knowledge in a field that brought excitement, curiosity,
            and sense of accomplishment. Of course I chose the latter.
