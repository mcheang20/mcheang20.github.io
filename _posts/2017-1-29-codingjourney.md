### How it started.

I never knew anything about writing code, wether its Ruby, or Javascript, until about 10 months ago. So how did a field that I knew very little of become something that I’m very passionate about?  It all started with some HTML and CSS.  

Like most people out there, if you happen to come across some HTML, CSS, or Javascript code, you have not the slightest clue as to what it means or what it does. However, it has always fascinated me wondering how it all functions. How do lines and lines of code create a fully functioning and responsive application that we, the users, are able to see and interact with? I dug a little further and did a little research and stumbled upon a site called CodeAcademy, a free interactive program that teaches the basics of various programming languages. With this tool I was able to delve deeper into my coding curiosity and I was hooked instantly!

Starting with HTML and CSS, then working my way to Javascript and Ruby I began to gain a better understanding of the design and concepts of code. Having worked through the CodeAcademy courses, I learned more and more but, most importantly, I was having fun at the same time. Working through the courses and seeing what the power of code can really do I wanted to learn more.  

Learning code was just a hobby at this point, but I wanted to expand my knowledge and have coding and programming mean more than just a side project. At this point I decided, leave the comfortable career path that I already had chosen, or start fresh and new and further develop my knowledge in a field that brought excitement, curiosity, and sense of accomplishment. Of course I chose the latter.

### Why web development?

My road to a new career started with Bloc's full stack web development program. Why web development? Though I like working on backend as much as the frontend, seeing your hard work appear on screen and being able to interact with it brings a huge smile to my face every time. The Bloc program was designed to have each student assigned to a mentor/s.  The mentor would serve as the guide to each student's learning every step of the way. My program focused mainly on the Ruby and Javascript languages as well as the Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, and jQuery frameworks. I knew the next 10 to 11 months would be challenging but I was ready for it. With the help of my mentors I was able to grasp the concepts of each framework and soon started working on several projects to showcase what I’ve learned but also continue to teach me new methods, ideas, and concepts.

Working on various projects was definitely the most challenging part of my program but it was also the part that I enjoyed the most. Creating an application from scratch, wether its an API, a music streaming service, or a content-sharing application, has showed me not just what coding can do but also what I can do. My coding journey has just started and I know I still have much to learn and that is what excites me the most.
