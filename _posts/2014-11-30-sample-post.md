title: My Coding Journey
---

I never knew anything about writing code, wether its Ruby, or Javascript, up until 10 months ago. So how did a field that I knew very little of become something that Iâ€™m very passionate about?  It all started with some HTML and CSS.  

Like most people out there, if you happen to come across some HTML or Javascript code, you have not the slightest clue as to what it means or what it does. However, it has always intrigued me as to how any of it all works. How do lines and lines of code create a fully functioning application that we, the users, are able to see and interact with? I did a little research and stumbled upon a site called CodeAcademy, a free interactive program that teaches the basics of various programming languages. With this tool I was able to delve deeper into my coding curiosity and I was hooked!

Starting with HTML and CSS, then working my way to Javascript and Ruby I began to gain a better understanding of the design and concepts of code. Having worked through the CodeAcademy courses, I realized how much fun and enjoyment I was having writing code and seeing it all come together and I wanted more.

Learning code was just a hobby at this point, but I wanted to expand my knowledge and have coding and programming mean more than just a hobby. At this point I decided, leave the comfortable career path that I already had chosen, or start fresh and new and further develop my knowledge in a field that brought excitement, curiosity, and sense of accomplishment. I chose the latter.

My road to a new career started with Bloc's full stack web development program. Why web development? Though I like working on backend as much as the frontend, the feeling of seeing your code working and appearing on screen is of pure excitement and sense of accomplishment. The Bloc program was designed to have each student assigned to a mentor/s.  The mentor would serve as the guide to each student's learning every step of the way. The program focused mainly on the Ruby and Javascript languages as well as the Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, and jQuery frameworks. I knew the next 10 to 11 months would be challenging but I was ready for it. With the help of my mentors I was able to grasp the concepts of each framework and developed projects on
