title: My Coding Journey
---

I never knew anything about writing code, wether its Ruby, or Javascript, or even about the Tech industry as a whole, up until 10 months ago. So how did a field that I knew very little of become something that Iâ€™m very passionate about?  It all started with some HTML and CSS.  

Like most people out there, if you happen to come across some HTML or Javascript code, you have not the slightest clue as to what it means.  However, it has always intrigued me as to how any of it all works. How do lines and lines of code create a fully functioning application that we, the users, are able to see and interact with? I did a little research and stumbled upon a site called Codeaacademy, a free interactive program that teaches the basics of various programming languages. With this tool I was able to delve deeper into my coding curiosity and I was hooked!

Starting with HTML and CSS, then working my way to Javascript and Ruby I began to gain a better understanding of the design and concepts of code. Having worked through the Codeacademy courses, I realized how much fun and enjoyment I was having writing code and seeing it all come together and I wanted more.
