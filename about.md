My name is Matt Cheang and I am an up and coming web developer with experience in the Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, and jQuery frameworks. You can read about how I started in web development through my [coding journey](/codingjourney). Feel free to take a look at my projects and view some of the work that I have designed and developed. If you have any questions feel free to [contact me](/contact/).
